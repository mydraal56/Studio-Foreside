                            Janelle specializes in color–specifically the hand painting technique called “balayage.” 
                            With more than 15 years of extensive color training, Janelle has the ability to utilize 
                            many different techniques to create a beautiful outcome. She enjoys creating natural yet 
                            multidimensional blondes, brunettes and redheads. Although her primary focus is color, 
                            she also enjoys mens cut, big voluminous blowouts and creating versatile yet effortless 
                            hairstyles. Janelle takes inspiration from current trends and hair artists while combining 
                            different elements and techniques to create personalized hair color and styles for each client.
                            If you want to get a little crazy, Janelle can take you there safely and confidently. Be it 
                            color, cut or styling.
